followize2
==========

  * Clicking name opens timeline like followize1 (open users remembered when
    display updates - just store list of names in fw.state.openUsers?).

  * Posting, replying, sending DMs.

  * Redesign (with refresh button, big progress meter on first load, small meter
    on periodical reload).

  * Read mentions and DMs.

  * Lists (subscriptions stored at Twitter and cached in globalStorage).

  * Cache state in sessionStorage.
