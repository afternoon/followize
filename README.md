Followize
=========

Followize is a Twitter client inspired by Gmail. It's optmised to make reading
efficient and easy.

Followize is a Google App Engine application written in Python and built on
Django, but the majority of the work is done client-side using JQuery.

The back-end component creates an OAuth session with Twitter. The client then
requests data directly via JSONP.
